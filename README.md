## 🧪 Experiments

### **Experiment 1: Basic HTML Structure 📄**  
**Location:** `Exp1/exp1.html`  
**Technologies:** HTML5  

**Description:**  
A simple, single-page website for *Anjuman-I-Islam’s Kalsekar Technical Campus*, demonstrating core HTML elements — headings, paragraphs, hyperlinks, tables with department info, and a contact form.

**How to Run:**  
```bash
open Exp1/exp1.html
```

---

### **Experiment 2: HTML with External CSS 🎨**  
**Location:** `Exp2/index.html`, `Exp2/styles.css`  
**Technologies:** HTML5, CSS3  

**Description:**  
A stylish webpage for *Asad’s Book Haven*, illustrating the separation of structure and presentation. The layout, fonts, and color scheme are defined through an external CSS file.

**How to Run:**  
```bash
open Exp2/index.html
```

---

### **Experiment 3: Responsive Design with Bootstrap 📱**  
**Location:** `Exp3/index.html`  
**Technologies:** HTML5, Bootstrap 5  

**Description:**  
A responsive online bookstore built using Bootstrap 5. Features include a navigation bar, hero section, and a responsive grid of book cards optimized for all devices.

**How to Run:**  
```bash
open Exp3/index.html
```

---

### **Experiment 4: JavaScript Form Validation ✅**  
**Location:** `Exp4/index.html`, `Exp4/style.css`  
**Technologies:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript  

**Description:**  
A registration form for *AIKTC Engineering* with JavaScript-based client-side validation. Checks for name length, valid email format, strong password, and 10-digit mobile number before submission.

**How to Run:**  
```bash
open Exp4/index.html
```

---

### **Experiment 5: React + TypeScript Frontend ⚛️**  
**Location:** `Exp5/src/App.tsx`, `Exp5/package.json`  
**Technologies:** React, TypeScript, Vite  

**Description:**  
A modern single-page form app built using React and TypeScript. Manages user input and validation using React Hooks (`useState`). Vite ensures fast builds and instant dev reloads.

**How to Run:**  
```bash
cd Exp5
npm install
npm run dev
# Application runs on http://localhost:5173
```

---

### **Experiment 6: Node.js Command-Line Calculator 🧮**  
**Location:** `Exp6/calculator.js`  
**Technologies:** Node.js  

**Description:**  
A Node.js-based command-line calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide) through user input in the console.

**How to Run:**  
```bash
cd Exp6
node calculator.js
```

---

### **Experiment 7: Network Simulation 🌐**  
**Location:** `Exp7/Exp7.pkt`  
**Technologies:** Cisco Packet Tracer  

**Description:**  
A network topology simulation demonstrating device connections, configurations, and packet flow within Cisco Packet Tracer.

**How to Run:**  
Open the `.pkt` file in Cisco Packet Tracer:  
**File → Open → `Exp7/Exp7.pkt`**

---

### **Experiment 8: Advanced Network Simulation 🌐**  
**Location:** `Exp8/Exp8.pkt`  
**Technologies:** Cisco Packet Tracer  

**Description:**  
An advanced simulation extending previous concepts with routing protocols and additional device configurations.

**How to Run:**  
**File → Open → `Exp8/Exp8.pkt`**

---

### **Experiment 9: Complex Network Troubleshooting 🌐**  
**Location:** `Exp9/Exp9.pkt`  
**Technologies:** Cisco Packet Tracer  

**Description:**  
A complex networking scenario designed for troubleshooting and analysis using Cisco Packet Tracer.

**How to Run:**  
**File → Open → `Exp9/Exp9.pkt`**

---

### **Experiment 10: Reserved for Future Development 🚧**  
**Location:** `Exp10/`  
**Status:** Reserved for upcoming experiments and enhancements.
